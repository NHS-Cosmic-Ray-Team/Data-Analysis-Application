# Data Analysis

✔️ Actively supported

## Description

This tool enables users to analyze datasets for patterns and trends. It provides access to graphs and statistics for the columns of a dataset.

## Usage

The first step is to simply upload a file. Once this is done, a triangular grid of checkboxes will be created with the column names on both the left and top. Selecting a checkbox will create a graph using the column on the left as the independent variable and the column on the right as the dependent variable. Once all desired checkboxes have been selected, simply scroll down to the "Analysis Results" section to view the results.

## Displayed Metrics

The following metrics are displayed when a checkbox is selected:

- Graph of the Independent Column vs. the Dependent Column
- Mean (of both columns)
- Standard Deviation (of both columns)
- Variance (of both columns)
- Minimum value (of both columns)
- Maximum value (of both columns)
- Median (of both columns)
- Mode (of both columns)
