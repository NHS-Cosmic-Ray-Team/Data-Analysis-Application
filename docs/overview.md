# Data Analysis Tool

## What is this?

This tool is meant to make processing data from the Cosmic Ray Tube easier. It offers two primary functions: data refinement and data analysis, each of which is described in further detail below.

## Features

- Accepts CSV files from a local device, Google Drive or Dropbox.
- Enables the reduction of CSV files to certain columns.
- Allows a user to define the specific rows to include in data refinement.
- Supports concatenating multiple files
- Offers analysis of the relationship between any two columns in a dataset.
- Shows a graph and basic statistics of any uploaded dataset.
- Supports export of a graph to Vernier LoggerPro.
